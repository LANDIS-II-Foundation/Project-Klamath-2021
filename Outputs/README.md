# From outputs to results

The outputs are obtained by running the LANDIS-II simulations as presented in the **Inputs** folder.
They are not present here because of the important storage place they need but can easely be recreated after downloading the installers (see **Installers** folder) and the inputs.

The scripts used to obtain the results from these outputs are available on this folder.
The ".pdf" files are made for a more easy reading and are available on this folder.
Both files (code and pdf) are referenced as mentioned in the report and form the annexes.

- **ANNEX4** presents tests concerning the insect risk implementation.
- **ANNEX5** presents all the operations needed to obtain the results presented in the Report (see **Report** folder) and additional information that isn't presented on the report. Only the results from the report are fully analysed on the text.
- **ANNEX6** aimed to explain why disturbancies (in particular fire) tends to disminish with time. An analyses of the Fire Weather Index is done as well as a comparison with results obtained with another climate model (CanSM).
- **ANNEX7** gives insights of possibles analyses of migration.

Due to issues related to data storage in different computers all along the realisation of the study, all the codes were not printed on pdf in time.
