# From outputs to results

The outputs are obtained by running the LANDIS-II simulations as presented in the "Inputs" folder.
They are not present here because of the important storage place they need.

The scripts used to obtain the results from these outputs are available on this folder.
The ".rmd" files can be directly used and are available on the folder "R project Results".

The ".pdf" files are made for a more easy reading and are available on this folder.
Both files (code and pdf) are referenced as mentioned in the report and forme the annexes.
