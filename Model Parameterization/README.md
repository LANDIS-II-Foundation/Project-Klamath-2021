# Model Parametrisation
All the modifications to the inputs are explained here.
- **ANNEX1** gives the method to set two rasters to the good extent (the klamath region present only on California).
- **ANNEX2** explains the method to create a single cell landscape to test different parameters without loosing time on computing large landscapes on LANDIS-II. It also guives the types of datatype settings needed to export rasters on a format compatible with LANDIS-II needings.
- **ANNEX3** presents the results of single cell tests concerning carbon and nitrogen sequestration on surface and rapid soil pools. The changes made in consequence on the input files are explained.

Please note that it is not compulsary to run these codes tu run the models. The data available on the **Input** folder is already modified and is ready to be used.
