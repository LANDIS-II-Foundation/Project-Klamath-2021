# Model Parametrisation
All the modifications made to the inputs during the study are explained here.

The scripts used to obtain the results from these outputs are available on this folder.
The ".pdf" files are made for a more easy reading and are available on this folder.
Both files (code and pdf) are referenced as mentioned in the report and form the annexes.

- **ANNEX1** gives the method to set two rasters to the good extent (the klamath region present only on California).
- **ANNEX2** explains the method to create a single cell landscape to test different parameters without loosing time on computing large landscapes on LANDIS-II. It also guives the types of datatype settings needed to export rasters on a format compatible with LANDIS-II needings.
- **ANNEX3** presents the results of single cell tests concerning carbon and nitrogen sequestration on surface and rapid soil pools. The changes made in consequence on the input files are explained.

Please note that it is not compulsary to run these codes to run the models. The data available on the **Input** folder is already modified and is ready to be used.
