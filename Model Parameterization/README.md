# Model Parametrisation
All the modifications made to the inputs during the study are explained here.
The input raster files for runing the codes, as well as the created ones, are available on the file **R inputs and outputs**.

The ".pdf" files are made for a more easy reading and are available on this folder.
Both files (code and pdf) are referenced as mentioned in the report and form the annexes.

- **ANNEX1** gives the method to set two rasters to the good extent (the klamath region present only on California). It also presents the method of implementing the Economic Resilience area and the Buffer zone to the management areas and the stands. A map of the repartition of the management areas is available.
- **ANNEX2** explains the method to create a single cell landscape to test different parameters without loosing time on computing large landscapes on LANDIS-II. It also guives the types of datatype settings needed to export rasters on a format compatible with LANDIS-II needings.
- **ANNEX3** presents the results of single cell tests concerning carbon and nitrogen sequestration on surface and rapid soil pools. The changes made in consequence on the input files are explained.

Please note that it is not compulsary to run these codes to run the models. The data available on the **Input** folder is already modified and is ready to be used.


Due to issues related to data storage in different computers all along the realisation of the study, the latest pdf vertion on ANNEX1 wasn't printed. The Rmd vertion is the latest one, The difference lays on the name of the Economic Resilience area, named before Resistance area. This will be updated as soon as possible.
