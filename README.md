# Forest management for climate adaptation: Effect of three management scenarios on the landscape disturbances and responses to climate change disturbancies and responses to climate change

## Presentation of the study

### Abstract
Because climate change will alter forest functioning, it is necessary to apply management that will allow the forest to adapt and to continue to provide ecosystem services. I focused on the Klamath region, situated at the North-West of California, an area experiencing rapid climate and forest changes. There is disagreement, however, as to the best management approach for this region. Therefore, I tested two management scenarios: an Adaptability scenario, that consists in avoiding obstacles to natural adaptation (increase connectivity, promote natural regeneration…) and a Pro-active scenario that consists in a human management of forest adaptation (assisted migration, economical resilience scenario on suitable sites…). I compared these management scenarios to a Business as usual scenario. To compare the management scenarios, I parametrized the mechanistic landscape model LANDIS-II and forecast forest change over 100 years. The management scenarios are compared regarding carbon sequestration, vulnerability to disturbances, forest sustainability and forest biodiversity. For these categories, a classification of the scenarios regarding their suitability is realised.

## Repository organisation
The aim of this repository is to make data and methods fully transparent and repeatable.

- **Report.** The report, defence presentation and grey vertion of the maps are available on this folder.
- In order to repeat the simulations, you first need to download and execute the extention installers available on **Installers.** All the parametrised files needed and instructions for their use are available on **Inputs**.
- For a full transparency on the method used, all the codes used are available and editable. Information concerning modifications to the input data is available on **Model Parametrisation**. Operations performed to obtain the results are available on **Outputs**. ".Rmd" files are ready to be downloaded and to run. ".pdf" files are present for a more pleasent consultation.
