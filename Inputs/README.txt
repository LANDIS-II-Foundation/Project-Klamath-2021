Here are presented the files necessary to run the LANDIS-II simulations.

In Base Inputs are the files in common to all the simulations. Among these, some climate files are too heavy for git hub.
These can be downloaded using the link on the file "Heavy base inputs".

The Business As Usual, Adaptability and Pro-active folders contain the files specific to the respective management scenario.


As an example, to run a Business As Usual scenario, it is needed to have on a same folder :

- The files of the "Base Inputs" folder
- The files of the link on the "Heavy base inputs" txt file
- The files of the "Business As Usual" folder
