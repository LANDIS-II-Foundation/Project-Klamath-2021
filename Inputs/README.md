# Input files used on the study

Here are presented the files used to run the LANDIS-II simulations.

## Experimental design

Three different management scenarios were tested: *Business as usual*, *Adaptability* or *Pro-active*; and each one was simulated two times.
Thus, six simulations were performed in total.

## Files common to all simulations

In the folder "/Base Inputs" are available the files in common to all the simulations. Among these, some climate files are too heavy for Git hub.
These can be downloaded using the link :

## Files specific to one management scenario

The Business As Usual, Adaptability and Pro-active folders contain the files specific to the respective management scenario.

## How to make a simulation

To make a simulations, you will need first to download the installers (see the file "/Installers").

All the files presented here are needed to run a scenario.
As an example, to run a Business As Usual scenario, it is needed to have on a same folder :

- The files of the "Base Inputs" folder
- The files of the link on the "Heavy base inputs" txt file
- The files of the "Business As Usual" folder

To run a simulation a second time, you just have to copy/paste the folder and run LANDIS-II again.
