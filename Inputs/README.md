# Input files used on the study

Here are available the files used to run the LANDIS-II simulations.

## Origin of the data

Majority of the data comes from Serra-Diaz *et al.* 2018 Scientific Reports and from Maxwell *et al.* 2021 Journal of Applied Ecology.

"These input files have been updated and subset to the California side of the study area only.  
New soils inputs are derived from a gridded SSURGO product for California dating from 2017. 
New IC map derived from Riley et al. 2019 interpolated plotlist/treelist.
New fire inputs for use with the SCRPPLE fire extension are based on the Short et al. 2017 dataset.
Insect inputs based on methods employed for the TCSI project, where timing of outbreak is based on USFS ADS outbreaks and mortality based on Fettig et al. 2019/Stanislaus plots."

## Experimental design

Three different management scenarios were tested: *Business as usual*, *Adaptability* or *Pro-active*; and each one was simulated two times.
Thus, six simulations were performed in total.

## Files common to all simulations

In the folder "/Base Inputs" are available the files in common to all the simulations. Among these, some climate files are too heavy for GitHub.
These can be downloaded using the link :

## Files specific to one management scenario

The Business As Usual, Adaptability and Pro-active folders contain the files specific to the respective management scenario.

## How to make a simulation

To make a simulations, you will need first to download the installers (see the file "/Installers").

All the files presented here are needed to run a scenario.
As an example, to run a Business As Usual scenario, it is needed to have on a same folder :

- The files of the "Base Inputs" folder
- The files of the link above
- The files of the "Business As Usual" folder

To run a simulation a second time, you just have to copy/paste the folder and run LANDIS-II again.
