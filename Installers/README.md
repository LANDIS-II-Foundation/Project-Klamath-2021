# Installers

Once downloaded and executed, these files will install the extentions used to run the simulations. This installers correspond to the vertions used for the study. As it was realised on summer 2021 they maybe hare not longer the latest vertions. Before installing the extention, be sure that LANDIS-II v7 is installed on your computer. More information at: http://www.landis-ii.org/install.

- **Biomass Harvest** simulates the forest management (thining, cuting, planting...) and allows to set management scenarios.
- **Dynamic Biomass Fuels** simulates the fuels dynamics. It is used only for setting the prescibed fire prescription of the harvest extention.
- **NECN Succession** simulates the trees and shrubs succession (reproduction, growth, competition and mortality) in interaction with the others extentions. It captures changes in species behavior due to climate change.
- **Output Biomass** creates output maps of the biomass by year and species. These outputs are used for computing the results.
- **Output Cohort Statistics** creates output maps. The ones used on the study are species richness by year and age richness by year.
- **SCRAPPLE** simulates fire behavior (ignition, spread, intensity...) in interaction with society (fire supression, human ignition...).
- **Biomass Biologilogical Disturbance Agents** simulates insectsoutbreaks (epicenter, spread, type of insect, trees preferences...). For now, this extention has not been released.
